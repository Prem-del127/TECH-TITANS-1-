This is my first hackathon project in college. 
We gained lots of knowledge in 24 hours of the hackathon. We designed a webpage of "Village Directory" in which it contains basic details of villages, including the area, availability, resources and many more.
We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for designing the page. We included the live location of the places on their webpages and linked to the national portal to connect directly to the schemes and know the eligibility.
